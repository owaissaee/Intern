## âœ… Git and GitHub Progress

- Created my **first GitHub repository** named `MyFirstRepo`.
- Cloned the repository to my local machine using `git clone`.
- Made some initial changes and pushed them to the `main` branch.
- Created **two sub-branches**:
  - `git-basics` for practicing Git commands.
  - `repo` for repository-related tasks.
- Committed changes in both branches and pushed them to GitHub.
