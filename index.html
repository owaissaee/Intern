    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>Today I started my diary. I learned Git and GitHub from scratch. It was interesting to understand version control and how to manage code repositories online.</p>
    <h2>Day 2</h2>
    <p>On the second day, I created my first repository and added files to it. It was exciting to see my code managed and tracked. I also learned about commits, branches, and merging. These concepts are fundamental in collaborating with others and maintaining a clean project history.</p>
